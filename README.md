We have stopped maintaining this repository, and we gonna develop BitcoinKit.

### Welcome to BitcoinCashKit

The BitcoinCashKit library is a Swift implementation of the Bitcoin cash protocol. This library is a fork of Katsumi Kishikawa's original BitcoinKit library aimed at supporting the Bitcoin cash eco-system.

It allows maintaining a wallet and sending/receiving transactions without needing a full blockchain node. It comes with a simple wallet app showing how to use it.

Release notes are [here](CHANGELOG.md).
